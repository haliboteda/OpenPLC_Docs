"""No unfinished work may live only in a map's CHANGE-LIST.

A CHANGE-LIST is an implementation inventory: it says what an effort will have
to touch, including everything already done. It is NOT a todo list, and nothing
scans it -- not the frontier script (which reads tickets), not work/TODO.md
(whose admission rule wants a closed ticket per row), not selfcheck. So an item
that is still outstanding can sit there indefinitely with nothing to surface it.

That is exactly what happened: `flashboot`, the compressed 'R' record format,
`setowner --wipe` and the release-notes rewrite were all designed, written down,
and then invisible to every tool. They were found by reading back a chat log.

This check makes the arrangement self-enforcing. Every CHANGE-LIST must carry a
banner naming where its unfinished work went, and each block it names must be
findable in work/TODO.md. Add a block to one side and forget the other, and this
goes red.

What it does NOT check: whether an individual table row is done. Those rows mark
who decides, not whether the code exists -- conflating the two is what made the
list unable to answer "how much is left" in the first place. The banner is the
contract; the rows stay a reference.

Exit code is the verdict: 0 every CHANGE-LIST is accounted for, 1 one is not.
