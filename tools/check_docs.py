"""Every check that guards this repo's documents, in one run.

    python tools/check_docs.py

Runs P7, P8, P9, P12, P13, P14 and P18, then a summary. The ids are the ones the
documents already cite (decision 78; the map "测试按部件、契约、整机三层重新分布").
P9 and P13 also read the code repos beside this one; a repo not cloned is
skipped by name, not failed.

Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = any failed.
