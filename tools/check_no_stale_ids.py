"""No renamed id may still appear anywhere.

Reads the old->new table produced by the renumbering effort and fails if any
old id is still cited anywhere in the product. A citation is an id carrying a
marker -- an introducing word, bold, or a table cell of its own. A bare token
is not: C1 and E8 occur all over C code and pin tables. This is the only thing that
can catch a missed rename: P7 compares two name lists with each other and P9
checks that paths resolve, so an id left behind in prose or in a source comment
is invisible to both.

    python3 tools/check_no_stale_ids.py            # judge, exit 1 on a hit
    python3 tools/check_no_stale_ids.py --list     # print the ids it is looking for

Exit codes: 0 no old id survives, 1 at least one does, 2 the table is missing.

Not part of selfcheck until the renumbering is actually done -- before that it
would report the ids that have not been changed yet, which is not a defect.
