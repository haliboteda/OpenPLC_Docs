"""One fact, one file: fail if the same claim is written out in two documents.

Case P8. Added 2026-08-22, when the user made "the same thing must be described
in exactly one file" a hard requirement. Thirty-odd documents is past the point
where that can be held by eye -- the 2026-08-22 sweep found nineteen duplicated
blocks, and three numbers that had drifted apart precisely because two files both
claimed them.

How it decides. Every document is split into sentences, markdown emphasis is
stripped so a bolded copy matches a plain one, and any sentence long enough to be
a claim that appears in two or more files is a failure. A pointer ("see X") is
short and generic, so pointing is never flagged -- which is the whole point: the
fix for a duplicate is a pointer.

What it reads. Every prose document in every repo that holds one: the bootloader
repo and its docs/, this repo, the three sibling repos' CLAUDE.md, and the whole
AI-Skills tree -- the product-level documents, the machine bring-up documents,
every skill body and the standing rules. AI-Skills came inside the walk on
2026-08-24, when the product-level documents moved into it; leaving it outside
would have taken most of the product's prose out of this guarantee silently,
while the check went on exiting 0.

One rule that is deliberately NOT an exception: the same rule stated in English
in a README and in Chinese in a CLAUDE.md does not collide, because the two
normalise differently. That is why the AI-Skills pair needs no entry in ALLOWED.

Fenced code blocks are reported separately and do NOT fail the run. Captured
serial output, log lines and shell commands get quoted in more than one place for
good reason: a release note has to show the customer the exact string they will
see, and an acceptance record has to show what the board actually printed. Those
quote the firmware, not each other -- the source of truth is the .c file.

    python tools/check_doc_dupes.py            report; exit 1 on prose duplicates
    python tools/check_doc_dupes.py --min 40   only longer claims
    python tools/check_doc_dupes.py --code     also list the code-block ones

Exit 0 = no prose claim appears twice, 1 = at least one does, 2 = setup problem.
