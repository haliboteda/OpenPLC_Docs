"""Every file path a document names has to exist.

Case P9. Added 2026-08-22 after the docs/ reorganisation broke 105 references and
every one of them was found by hand. Two of the places that broke are the worst
possible ones: the skill files, which are what a new session reaches for first --
they misled at the exact moment nobody yet knew their way around, and nothing
would ever have told anyone.

It checks only the three shapes whose base directory is unambiguous:

  * markdown links            [text](path/to/OWNERSHIP.md)      -- relative to the doc
  * repo-var paths            $PROD/docs/tables/DECISIONS.md
  * backticked docs/ paths    `$PROD/work/TODO.md`             -- some repo root

$PROD names the product-level documents, which live in the AI-Skills checkout.
It exists because a relative link from a product repo into AI-Skills is not
writable: AI-Skills is shared across projects and does not sit beside the product
repos. So a citation that crosses that boundary has to be a backticked $PROD/...
-- and being a repo-var path, it gets checked. A missing AI-Skills clone is a
setup failure (exit 2), not a warning: without it most of the link graph goes
unchecked, and a check that goes green while blind is worse than no check.

⚠️ **It deliberately ignores every other backticked path**, and that is the whole
design. The docs write `tools/init_machine.py` and `host/fakeboard/run_cases.py`
meaning "relative to whichever repo this paragraph is about", which a checker
cannot know. The first version guessed, and reported 154 dead references of which
about five were real. A check that cries wolf 150 times is worse than no check --
this project has already paid for that lesson twice: a flaky case that trained
people to re-run it, and a warning everyone learned to ignore. Narrower coverage
that can be trusted beats broader coverage that cannot.

What that costs: a bare `tools/foo.py` that gets deleted still goes unnoticed.
Write `$TEST/tools/path/to/foo.py` when you want it checked.

Line numbers in a path (fmc.c:153-193) are stripped before checking: the file has
to exist, but a line number is a hint and drifts by design -- M4 already carries
the scar of trusting one.

Documents outside the two code repos are checked too. AI-Skills is not a sibling
of the others on every machine, so it is located rather than assumed.

    python tools/check_doc_paths.py           report; exit 1 on a dead reference
    python tools/check_doc_paths.py --list    print every path it resolved

Two more checks on markdown links (2026-09-24), because a link can reach an
existing file and still be wrong:

  * a #fragment has to be an anchor the target really has -- a heading turned
    into an anchor the way GitHub does it, or an explicit <a id>. A heading that
    changed from "all 9 commands" to "all 8" left its links pointing at nothing,
    and the file-exists check stayed green.
  * link text that is itself a path has to name the file the link goes to. The
    target gets corrected when a file moves; the text often does not.

Link text that is a sentence is not checked -- only a path can be compared.

Exit 0 = every named path exists, 1 = at least one does not, 2 = setup problem.
