"""A requirement and the case it cites have to agree, both ways.

Case P7. Reads the module documents under $PROD/docs/modules/, where both
tables live: the feature table names requirements and the case each one leans
on, the test table names cases and the requirement each one covers.

What it catches:

  * a case cited as evidence that no test table defines
    (a requirement pointing at a case nobody can run);
  * a case defined in a test table that no requirement cites
    (a test whose result nobody records, so nobody notices when it rots);
  * a requirement id in a test row's back-reference column that no feature
    table defines.

The third one is new. Before the restructure the case tables had no column
pointing back at the requirement, so a test could claim to cover anything.

What it does NOT catch: a status that is simply out of date -- "T3-01 failed
yesterday but R3-01 still says ✅". That needs the run result to reach the
table by itself, and today a person types it in.

    python tools/check_status_sync.py           report and exit 1 on any drift
    python tools/check_status_sync.py --list    just print what it parsed

Exit 0 = they agree, 1 = they do not, 2 = a document was not found.
